# About me

I am a student at Solent University in Southampton (UK), trying to carve out a career in programming.

I'm learning various different tasks in languages such as Java, C++, Python as well as Javascript and others. It would be 
better to focus on one area at a time but I try my best nonetheless. 

Happy and open to collaborate in any capacity as I'm seeking any and all opportunities to learn and grow.

I do not know what my end goal is as of yet, I'm simply enjoying the ride as it's happening.
